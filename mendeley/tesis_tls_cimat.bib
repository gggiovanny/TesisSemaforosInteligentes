abstract = {This monograph provides both a unified account of the development of models and methods for the problem of estimating equilibrium traffic flows in urban areas and a survey of the scope and limitations of present traffic models. The development is described and analyzed by the use of the powerful instruments of nonlinear optimization and mathematical programming within the field of operations research. The first part is devoted to mathematical models for the analysis of transportation network equilibria; the second deals with methods for traffic equilibrium problems. This title will interest readers wishing to extend their knowledge of equilibrium modeling and analysis and of the foundations of efficient optimization methods adapted for the solution of large-scale models. In addition to its value to researchers, the treatment is suitable for advanced graduate courses in transportation, operations research, and quantitative economics.

abstract = {This paper describes a new methodology adopted for urban traffic stream optimization. By using Petri net analysis as fitness function of a Genetic Algorithm, an entire urban road network is controlled in real time. With the advent of new technologies that have been published, particularly focusing on communications among vehicles and roads infrastructures, we consider that vehicles can provide their positions and their destinations to a central server so that it is able to calculate the best route for one of them. Our tests concentrate on comparisons between the proposed approach and other algorithms that are currently used for the same purpose, being possible to conclude that our algorithm optimizes traffic in a relevant manner. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
