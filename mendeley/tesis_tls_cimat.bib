abstract = {The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds vast potential for transportation systems through improved safety, efficiency, and access to mobility. However, due to numerous technical, political, and human factors challenges, new methodologies are needed to design vehicles and transportation systems for these positive outcomes. This article tackles important technical challenges arising from the partial adoption of autonomy (hence termed mixed autonomy, to involve both AVs and human-driven vehicles): partial control, partial observation, complex multi-vehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of traffic settings represented by real-world networks. To enable the study of the full diversity of traffic settings, we first propose to decompose traffic control tasks into modules, which may be configured and composed to create new control tasks of interest. These modules include salient aspects of traffic control tasks: networks, actors, control laws, metrics, initialization, and additional dynamics. Second, we study the potential of model-free deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to address the complexity of traffic dynamics. The resulting modular learning framework is called Flow. Using Flow, we create and study a variety of mixed-autonomy settings, including single-lane, multi-lane, and intersection traffic. In all cases, the learned control law exceeds human driving performance (measured by system-level velocity) by at least 40{\%} with only 5-10{\%} adoption of AVs. In the case of partially-observed single-lane traffic, we show that a low-parameter neural network control law can eliminate commonly observed stop-and-go traffic. In particular, the control laws surpass all known model-based controllers, achieving near-optimal performance across a wide spectrum of vehicle densities (even with a memoryless control law) and generalizing to out-of-distribution vehicle densities.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new methodology adopted for urban traffic stream optimization. By using Petri net analysis as fitness function of a Genetic Algorithm, an entire urban road network is controlled in real time. With the advent of new technologies that have been published, particularly focusing on communications among vehicles and roads infrastructures, we consider that vehicles can provide their positions and their destinations to a central server so that it is able to calculate the best route for one of them. Our tests concentrate on comparisons between the proposed approach and other algorithms that are currently used for the same purpose, being possible to conclude that our algorithm optimizes traffic in a relevant manner. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@book{Patriksson2012,
abstract = {This monograph provides both a unified account of the development of models and methods for the problem of estimating equilibrium traffic flows in urban areas and a survey of the scope and limitations of present traffic models. The development is described and analyzed by the use of the powerful instruments of nonlinear optimization and mathematical programming within the field of operations research. The first part is devoted to mathematical models for the analysis of transportation network equilibria; the second deals with methods for traffic equilibrium problems. This title will interest readers wishing to extend their knowledge of equilibrium modeling and analysis and of the foundations of efficient optimization methods adapted for the solution of large-scale models. In addition to its value to researchers, the treatment is suitable for advanced graduate courses in transportation, operations research, and quantitative economics.
