abstract = {We release new benchmarks in the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL) to create controllers for mixed-autonomy traffic, where connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) interact with human drivers and infrastructure. Benchmarks , such as Mujoco or the Arcade Learning Environment, have spurred new research by enabling researchers to effectively compare their results so that they can focus on algorithmic improvements and control techniques rather than system design. To promote similar advances in traffic control via RL, we propose four benchmarks, based on three new traffic scenarios, illustrating distinct reinforcement learning problems with applications to mixed-autonomy traffic. We provide an introduction to each control problem, an overview of their MDP structures, and preliminary performance results from commonly used RL algorithms. For the purpose of reproducibility, the benchmarks, reference implementations, and tutorials are available at https://github.com/flow-project/flow.},

abstract = {Evolutionary Computation (EC) mimics evolution processes to solve burdensome computational problems, like the design, optimization and reverse engineering of complex systems, and its effectiveness is tied to a proper formalization of the candidate solutions. Petri Net (PN) formalism is extensively exploited for the modeling, simulation and analysis of the structural and behavioral properties of complex systems. Here we introduce a novel evolutionary algorithm inspired by EC, the Evolutionary Petri Net (EPN), which is based on an extended class of PNs, called Resizable Petri Net (RPN), provided with two genetic operators: mutation and crossover. RPN includes the new concept of hidden places and transitions, that are used by the genetic operators for the optimization of PN-based models. We present a potential application of EPNs to face one of the most challenging problems in Systems Biology, the reverse engineering of biochemical reaction networks.},

abstract = {The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds vast potential for transportation systems through improved safety, efficiency, and access to mobility. However, due to numerous technical, political, and human factors challenges, new methodologies are needed to design vehicles and transportation systems for these positive outcomes. This article tackles important technical challenges arising from the partial adoption of autonomy (hence termed mixed autonomy, to involve both AVs and human-driven vehicles): partial control, partial observation, complex multi-vehicle interactions, and the sheer variety of traffic settings represented by real-world networks. To enable the study of the full diversity of traffic settings, we first propose to decompose traffic control tasks into modules, which may be configured and composed to create new control tasks of interest. These modules include salient aspects of traffic control tasks: networks, actors, control laws, metrics, initialization, and additional dynamics. Second, we study the potential of model-free deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to address the complexity of traffic dynamics. The resulting modular learning framework is called Flow. Using Flow, we create and study a variety of mixed-autonomy settings, including single-lane, multi-lane, and intersection traffic. In all cases, the learned control law exceeds human driving performance (measured by system-level velocity) by at least 40{\%} with only 5-10{\%} adoption of AVs. In the case of partially-observed single-lane traffic, we show that a low-parameter neural network control law can eliminate commonly observed stop-and-go traffic. In particular, the control laws surpass all known model-based controllers, achieving near-optimal performance across a wide spectrum of vehicle densities (even with a memoryless control law) and generalizing to out-of-distribution vehicle densities.},
